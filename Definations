Fraud detection is the process of identifying and preventing fraudulent activities or unauthorized actions within a system or organization. 
Fraud can occur in various contexts, including financial transactions, online activities, healthcare claims, insurance claims, and more. 
The primary goal of fraud detection is to detect and mitigate fraudulent behavior to minimize financial losses, protect sensitive information, 
and maintain trust and integrity in the system or organization.

Decision trees are a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. 
A decision tree is a tree-like model that makes decisions by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the values of features, 
ultimately leading to a decision or prediction. Each node of the tree represents a decision based on a feature, and the edges represent 
the possible outcomes of that decision.
